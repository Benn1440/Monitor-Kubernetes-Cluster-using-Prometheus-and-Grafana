## Overview

Monitoring Kubernetes clusters is crucial for maintaining the health and performance of applications. Prometheus is an open-source monitoring tool that collects and stores metrics, while Grafana is a data visualization tool that displays these metrics in customizable dashboards. Together, they provide a powerful solution for cluster monitoring.

** Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster (local or cloud-based).

- kubectl command-line tool configured to interact with your cluster.
